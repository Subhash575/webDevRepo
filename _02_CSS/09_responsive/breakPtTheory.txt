#How responsive design-work:-
Whenever we work with the mobile responsive device, we have to actually provide some "media queries".
The media queries are nothing. Thery are annotated symbols which specifically mention that hey what do you want to happen on a screen/display at a certain "pixel size".

/*
some etxra point:-
In device If we get the display behavior like android then we show pop up where we
say download "android-app(phone)" similarly for "i-phone-app(phone)" as well.
*/

media queries have two break-pt: 1.max-width  2.min-width
1.max-width: max always says that I will work till this breakpoint.
2.min-width: min always says that minimum this amount of width is actually require to
be functional, to be working.
