#What is Bootstrap?
Simply saying somebody sat down for you and wrote so many CSS classes for you.
and just by putting this classes on right place, you can style your component.
for eg: You have your button, somebody has written a "class" named as "btn" and
"btn-primary", and you just have to inject these two classes in your component or your
button and that's it.
your button will look out of the box.
