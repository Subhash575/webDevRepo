1pt(imp): Always use border to see what space your content is taking it will made
the thing easily understandable why certain property not working.
ex: If you not give height to container and then set certain property 
    display:flex;
    align-items:center;
    justify-content:cent;
If you not give certain amount of height and width this property not work to checking
how much space it take you can use "border-property" here.
The reason it bcs element take only the require height according to content.
