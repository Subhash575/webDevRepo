# Here we learn about the after effect property of css. You see this property on 
"navbar.html" file.
        .nav1 a::after {
            content = ""
            // content is complusory in this css property 
            // and this is inline in nature.
            // You can learn more on mdn css docs.
            
        }

        .nav1 a:hover::after{

        }

        similarly to "after" their is "before" property as well.
