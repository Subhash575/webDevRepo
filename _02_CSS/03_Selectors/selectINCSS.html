     styling work.)

       above hash code it converts into "HSL: Hue Saturation and lightness" , HWB(Hue Whiteness and Blackness),
        rgb, hash code(most common one is the hash code) these are the different color format.*/

        color in different shades which is not good for "professional website" therefore we can generally use
        the "hash color" format.
        ex:-
        color: red; (not use normally/ not prefer)

     paragraph(p) which is sibling or not it is not selected */

    behaviors when you select the input, different behaviors when you put the mouse over it and you can 
    control all of these properties based on what element you are targeting. */
