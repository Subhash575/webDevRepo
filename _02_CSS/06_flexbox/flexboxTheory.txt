#CSS: Flexbox
When we go with the Flexbox. There are two concept you always need to remember
1. Main Access     2. Other Access/ Alternative Access

In the "world of web". Whenever you say  Flexbox that means "Main Access" is going
to run from left to right.

The reason for that is some of the properties is attach with "Main Access" and some of the
properties is attach with the "Other Access".

(Additional point):-
In Mobile app "Main Access" is from top to bottom.
We normally use flexbox to make two or more div container inline. So that we can 
structure our website.
