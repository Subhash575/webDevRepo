2. Background-image property:-
The background-image property sets one or more background images for an element.
By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.
Tip: The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).

3. Background-size:- w3 school
The background-size property specifies the size of the background images.
There are four different syntaxes you can use with this property: the keyword syntax ("auto", "cover" and "contain"), the one-value syntax sets the width of the image (height becomes "auto"), the two-value syntax (first value: width of the image, second value: height), and the multiple background syntax (separated with comma).

//We can use linear - gradient on background image.
background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow, blue);
