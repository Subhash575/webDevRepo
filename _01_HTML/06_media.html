    <!--Video Tag -->
    <!--(imp)Whenever their is "video tag" the additional attribute you need  to add which
        is "controls" -->
    <!-- controlslist is important attribute in Video Tag: By using this we can prove
     only specific feature of the video for ex: We don't want to provide download option,
     or also don't want to provide full screen option or any option then you can use
     "controlslist" attribute for that -->
     <!-- Some time we can use javascript for controlslist type attribute -->
    <video src="./image/stdyVideo.mp4" width="400px" controls
    controlslist="nofullscreen nodownload noremoteplayback noplaybackrate foobar">study video</video>

    <!-- Basic "audio tag": Remember without "controls" you cannot do anything -->
    <audio src="./image/music_audio.m4a"  controls>This is audio</audio>

<!--Another way to use audio tag -->
<!-- AUDIO TAG(Detail):-
    Definition and Usage
The <audio> tag is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other 
 audio streams.

The <audio> tag contains one or more <source> tags with different audio sources.
 The browser will choose the first source it supports.

The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers
 that do not support the <audio> element.

There are three supported audio formats in HTML: MP3, WAV, and OGG. -->
<!-- <audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>    -->

<!-- ARIA TAG:- This tag totally associated with the accessibility. 
  ARIA: (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
  If you want to make any web application very rich so that any device can actually
   operate and any device can serve that, that's where you take care of the ARIA-->

  <!-- Whenever you're making any application which is centric towards banking or 
   government website, this is the part where we come and study about it
   Can somebody excess the entire website just with a keyboard, Can somebody
   excess it with the speech recognization software and so much more.
   If you need to learn then refer (mdn docs). -->

   <!-- Here we can lean more about audio or video tag on the go when time comes. -->
